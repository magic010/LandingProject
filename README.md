# Landing Page Project

This is my first project, and I hope to be successful in using the tools that I learned to implement what is required of me in this project.

## what i have done

```
I have added the sections via JavaScript.

I created a function to create a link for each section.

Modified the active class properties for sections.

Made a collapsible list of sections.

Made the navbar responsive.

I made the link header disappear when not scrolling and reappear with just a scroll.
